// Duplicate the logic for testing since I didn't export it.
// In a real scenario, I would export BeadsManager.
// For now, I'll just create a test file that imports the compiled class if I exported it, 
// but I didn't export the class in index.ts.
// So I will modify index.ts to export BeadsManager first.
